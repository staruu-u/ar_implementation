# ar_implementation

this should have some of the filters

the widget uses unityLibrary in the android folder :)
if the code doesn't build ask me for help it might have something to do with your computer not being able to find an SDK, JDK, or not high enough API level
it might also be because your computer not having Unity
also this doesn't build on an emulator so you need an actual android device
